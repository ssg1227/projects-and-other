Here’s how you can design a **Dining Predictor System for Carnival Legend** (or similar cruise lines) that balances **passenger satisfaction** with **minimized food waste**, factoring in seasonality, itinerary, demographics, and optional health/ethnicity data.

# GALLEY – Guest Appetite Logistics & Less Excess Yield
---

## 1️⃣ **Core Objectives**

* **Predict passenger meal preferences and dining patterns** (e.g., buffet vs. formal dining vs. specialty restaurants).
* **Adjust provisioning and prep volumes** dynamically to **reduce food waste**.
* Tailor offerings to **time of year**, **cruise region**, and **passenger demographics** (optional personalization).

---

## 2️⃣ **Key Data Inputs**

### A. Passenger Data (per sailing)

* Age distribution (families with kids, seniors, young adults)
* Home region/country (proxy for cuisine familiarity)
* Loyalty tier (e.g., Carnival VIFP Club may indicate repeat preferences)
* Special dietary needs (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, kosher)
* (Optional) Health/fitness preferences (low-sodium, diabetic-friendly meals)

### B. Cruise-Specific Factors

* **Time of year**: Summer vs. winter menus (lighter meals vs. hearty foods)
* **Cruise region**: Caribbean (tropical fruit, seafood), Alaska (hearty soups, salmon), Mediterranean (olive oil-heavy dishes).
* Duration of cruise: Short cruises → high buffet traffic; long cruises → more formal dining rotation.

### C. Operational Data

* Historical food consumption data from previous cruises (linked to itinerary and passenger mix).
* Waste logs (what’s consistently leftover vs. popular).
* Inventory and provisioning cycles.

---

## 3️⃣ **Prediction Logic**

### Model Options:

* **Baseline Model (Heuristics/Rules)**

  * Use historical data grouped by cruise itinerary, season, and passenger mix.
  * Example: "7-day Caribbean cruise in summer with 50% families → high buffet breakfast traffic, lower fine dining demand."

* **Machine Learning Model (Supervised Learning)**

  * Inputs: Cruise features (region, season), passenger demographics, historical dining logs.
  * Output: Predicted daily demand per dining venue, meal type (veg/non-veg), cuisine category.
  * Model Type: Regression (for meal quantities) + Classification (for cuisine type preferences).

* **Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive)**

  * System learns from ongoing cruise consumption patterns and adjusts meal prep dynamically (e.g., Day 2 breakfast waste feeds into Day 3 prep adjustment).

---

## 4️⃣ **System Design**

### Workflow:

1. **Pre-Cruise Prediction**

   * Use booked passenger data + cruise region/season to forecast:

     * Dining split (buffet vs MDR vs specialty)
     * Cuisine type demand (e.g., Asian, Continental, Vegan)
     * Meal timing preferences (early vs late seating).

2. **Real-Time Adjustment During Cruise**

   * Track actual meal selections daily via POS (Point of Sale in restaurants).
   * Update predictions (reduce/increase prep quantities).

3. **Post-Cruise Learning**

   * Store consumption vs waste stats to retrain the model for future sailings.

---

## 5️⃣ **Example Architecture**

* **Data ingestion**: Passenger manifest, loyalty CRM, health/diet data (opt-in), past consumption logs.
* **Modeling**: TensorFlow/Keras or scikit-learn for ML models.
* **Dashboard**: Web-based interface for dining managers showing predicted demand vs inventory.
* **Integration**: Hook into cruise POS & provisioning systems.

---

## 6️⃣ **Optional: Personalized Recommendations**

If individual-level data is allowed (GDPR-compliant opt-in):

* Suggest dining slots via the Carnival Hub app (reduce crowding).
* Push personalized dish recommendations ("We noticed you enjoyed vegetarian curry last night—similar dishes available at the buffet").
* Health-conscious nudges: For diabetic passengers, surface low-sugar options.

---

## 7️⃣ **Benefits**

✅ Improved passenger satisfaction (right meals at right time).
✅ Reduced food waste (align provisioning to actual demand).
✅ Smarter inventory = lower costs.
✅ Data-driven cruise culinary planning.
