✅ Solution Options
1. Serve Files Using a Local Dev Server (Recommended)
Instead of opening HTML files directly, run a local server:

Option A: Use VS Code Live Server Extension (Easy)

Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server.

Your app will run at http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

sudo npm install -g serve; sync;sync;sync; serve .
serve .
